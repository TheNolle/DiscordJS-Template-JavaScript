Welcome to my JavaScript-based Discord bot boilerplate! This project is an easy-to-use, efficient, and beginner-friendly starting point for Discord bot development. The goal is to make bot development a breeze, without struggling with initial setup and boilerplate code. 🚀

This template is built with `discord.js v14.11.0`, using `node.js v16+` and `npm v8+`. `pnpm` is highly recommended for faster package management but not obligatory. 📦


## Getting Started 📚

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheNolle/DiscordJS-Bot-Template.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```
3. Rename `config.json.template` to `config.json`and fill it with your informations.
4. Run the bot:
```bash
pnpm run start
```
